Here is a study guide I put together while preparing for the UW Biostatistics
second-year PhD theory exam. I hope some people may find it useful.

I would also recommend checking out [these materials](https://ethanashby.github.io/teaching/theory_exam) prepared by another UW Biostats student, Ethan Asbhy, which include many more examples and course-specific notes.
