<p>Over the past three weeks, the United States government has approved two different COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. These two vaccines, one developed by Pfizer and the other by Moderna, are actually quite similar in that they are both two-dose mRNA vaccines with mild side-effects, and they have almost identical efficacy rates (95% and 94.1% respectively according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">FDA</a>). The only notable <a href="https://abc7.com/moderna-and-pfizer-vaccine-whats-the-difference-between-side-effects-effectiveness/8815593/">difference</a> is that the Moderna vaccine can be stored in a standard freezer while the Pfizer vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius, making it slightly less accessible for small healthcare centers.</p>
<p>Consequently, U.S. vaccine rollout plans have so far treated the two vaccines as essentially being the same, that is to say neither of the two vaccines is considered better than the other. This somewhat unexpected fact has simplified the already <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silver-criticism-covid-vaccine-report-interpretation-1556198">controversial</a> rollout, but the impending introductions of new vaccines from companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZaneca threaten to introduce a new complexity. If a new vaccine with only 70% efficacy becomes available, how should it be incorporated into the rollout? Is it better to give at-risk patients a worse vaccine if it means they can get vaccinated a month earlier? Will people even want it?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are certainly complex, and they will likely draw from principles in biology, mathematics, statistics, and economics among other fields. I cannot pretend to be an expert here - I am hopeful that the true experts have been thinking deeply about this issue - but I think the problem is quite fascinating. This post contains my thoughts and some basic modeling!</p>
<section id="what-is-vaccine-efficacy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-vaccine-efficacy">What is Vaccine Efficacy?</h2>
<p>Before moving any further, let’s make sure we understand what vaccine efficacy is. Essentially, it is a measure of how well a vaccine prevents cases of the disease in a group of vaccinated subjects compared to a control group of un-vaccinated (received placebo) subjects. An estimate of the efficacy is generated from clinical trial data, which every vaccine must collect and submit to the FDA for review before being made available to the public.</p>
<p>The actual calculation of efficacy relies on a term called <em>risk</em>. In epidemiology, <em>risk</em> is the probability that an event (such as infection) will occur in a given time period, and it is measured in a clinical trial as the proportion of total subjects in a group who experienced the event in the time period that they were followed. For example, if 8 out of 1,000 patients who receive an actual vaccine in a clinical trial become infected with COVID-19, then the estimate of risk of infection in the vaccination group is simply 0.008, or 0.8%. The ratio of risk in the treatment (actual vaccine) group compared to the risk in the control (placebo) group is called the <em>risk ratio</em>. Risk ratios below 1 suggest that the treatment reduces the risk of disease compared to the control, and smaller ratios suggest a stronger reduction. Efficacy is calculated as 1 - Risk Ratio, so an efficacy closer to 1 (or 100%) means that the vaccine reduces the risk of infection by a greater proportion. You can read more about vaccine efficacy on the CDC website <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that ratios are multiplicative, not additive, so we can intepret 95% vaccine efficacy (the equivalent to 100%-95% = 5% risk ratio) as meaning that the risk for COVID in the vaccine group is 0.05 (5%) times the risk in the control group.</p>

<section id="a-simple-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-simple-model">A Simple Model</h2>
<p>To assess the potential effects of different vaccine rollouts, we will create a model of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Our first step will be to develop a simple framework using principles from epidemiology before adding more complex features. For this simple model, we divide the population of the United States into four groups: susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered and immune (R), and deceased (D). At a specific point in time, every individual should fall into one and only one of these categories.</p>
<p>With these categories established, our next job is to determine a way to describe the flow of individuals from group to group. See <strong>Diagram 1</strong> below:</p>
<center>
<div class="cell" data-layout-align="center">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div id="htmlwidget-e2e6aa9afe7fec19e188" style="width:100%;height:232px;" class="grViz html-widget "></div>

</div>
</div>
</center>
<p>We are interested in how the flow of individuals occurs over time, so we will measure it as the rate at which people exit/enter a group per day. Below we explore each arrow on the diagram above:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S → I:</strong> The rate at which susceptible individuals become infected. This value intuitively depends on the rate of contact between susceptible and infected individuals as well as the probability that the disease would be transmitted given a contact occurs. Here we introduce our first parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, which captures the <em>rate of transmission</em>. We can calculate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> using <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>, the more intuitive “basic reproductive rate” of a disease, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the recovery rate (which is calculated as as 1/length of infectious period), and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the population size, because:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\beta = \frac{R_0 \gamma}{N}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, S → I is described by <span class="math inline">\(\beta S I\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> are the number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of individuals in groups S and I.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>I → D:</strong> The rate at which infected individuals die. This depends on our second parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, and a third parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the death rate. As the inverse of the infectious period, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> captures the average number of infected individuals that stop being infectious each day (i.e.&nbsp;if the infectious period is 5 days, then 1/5 of infectious individuals stop being infectious each day). As the death rate, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> tells us what fraction of individuals leaving <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> are headed to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> (what percent die), while the rest, or 1-<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, recover and head to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Thus, I → D is described by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma I\mu\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I → R:</strong> The rate at which infected individuals recover. Using logic from I → D, above we have I → D is described by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma I(1-\mu)\)</span>. Note that the total rate at which individuals exit <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is simply <span class="math inline">\(\gamma I\)</span> because every infected individual either dies or recovers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R → S:</strong> The rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and become susceptible again. This value depends on a fourth paramter, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, the inverse of the period of immunity. It is the same idea as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With these rates determined, we can now create a system of ordinary differential equations to describe the flow of people between groups. For each group, the change in size with respect to time (the derivative) is simply the sum of the rates with which people enter it (arrows entering the box) minus the rates with which people leave (arrows leaving the box). Thus, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -\beta S I + \omega R \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \beta S I - \gamma I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I(1-\mu) - \omega R\\
\frac{dD}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I(\mu)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>where the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> are the transmission rate, recovery rate, loss of immunity rate, and death rate, respectively. If we set values for each of these parameters based on our knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic and set initial sizes for each group, we can track the course of the disease by solving this system of ordinary differential equations for each day to model how the disease might progress.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-long-term-immunity-vaccines">Adding Long-Term Immunity: Vaccines</h2>
<p>Now that we have established the basic theoretical framework of the model, we can start to add complexities such as vaccines. Vaccinated individuals will come out of the susceptible group and enter a new group with different properties from the four we established before. See <strong>Diagram 2</strong> below:</p>

<p>This model assumes that every vaccinated individual is protected completely from infection, but we know that this is not the case for COVID-19 vaccines in the real world. Accounting for this fact and supposing that individuals can receive one of two different vaccines, we have a new model detailed in <strong>Diagram 3</strong>.</p>

<p>Assuming that the number of vaccines given per day, <span class="math inline">\(\nu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_2\)</span>, and the rates of success, <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2\)</span>, for each vaccine are known, we now have the following system of ordinary differential equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -\beta S I + \omega R -  \nu_1  -  \nu_2 \\
\frac{dV_{1}}{dt} &amp;= \nu_1 - (1-\varphi_1) \beta V_1 I\\
\frac{dV_{2}}{dt} &amp;= \nu_2 - (1-\varphi_2) \beta V_2 I \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \beta S I - \gamma I + (1-\varphi_1)\beta V_{1} I + (1-\varphi_2)\beta V_{2} I \\ &amp;= \beta I[S + (1-\varphi_1)V_{1} + (1-\varphi_2)V_{2}] - \gamma I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I(1-\mu) - \omega R\\
\frac{dD}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I(\mu)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>There are obviously a number of assumptions that this model is making for the sake of simplicity. The big ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every individual has the same <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, that is the same probability of coming into contact with an infected individual and then contracting it.</li>
<li>Actually, all the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\nu_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\nu_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2\)</span> are constant throughout the population and over time.</li>
<li>The population is closed other than COVID deaths. No births or deaths from other causes are accounted for.</li>
</ul>
<p>We should be okay with most of these assumptions for the sake of our simple model. Accounting for the ways in which behavioral changes, weather patterns, and government policies change the parameters would help the model better reflect the real life course of the virus, but we will leave that to the <a href="https://research.columbia.edu/covid/mapping/survival-convolution">experts</a>. With that said, there is one key factor that is currently being ignored - age.</p>
<p>It is well known that virus impacts different age groups in very different ways. In terms of our parameters, the death rate, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, varies greatly across age groups. On top of that, the vaccine rollout plans (impacting <span class="math inline">\(\nu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_2\)</span>) will also certainly account for differences in age. In the following section, I discuss how we can incorporate age classes into our model.</p>
</section>
<section id="adding-age-classes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-age-classes">Adding Age Classes</h2>
<p>Let’s now suppose that our population is made up of distinct age classes where <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> is the number of individuals in age group <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. For our purposes, we will use the age classes (with their corresponding N and death rates) detailed below:</p>

<p>The seemingly simple, however incorrect, approach would be to run our previously specified vaccine model on each age group individually and calculate the overall size of each group as the sum of its size in each age group. For example, <span class="math inline">\(S = \sum_{i=1}^{18} S_i\)</span>. The problem with this approach is that it assumes that individuals only interact with, and therefore can only be infected by, people in the same age class. This is clearly not reflective of the real world.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we need a <strong>contact matrix</strong>. A contact matrix describes the contacts between age group <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and age group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. As an example, let’s suppose that there are 900 students and 100 teachers in a school. Students make on average 40 contacts with other students and 10 contacts with teachers per day. Since the ratio of students to teachers is 9:1, students making 10 contacts with teachers on average means that teachers make on 10*9 = 90 contacts with students per day an average. Now also assume that the teachers only make contact with 5 other teachers per day on average. The contact matrix would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
40 &amp; 10 \\
90 &amp; 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>These contact matrices have a few cool properties. You can read more about them <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4002176/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of the student-to-teacher ratio in the example above, contact matrices based on one demographic or social structure are are not generally compatible with other structures. Conveniently, a 2017 <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697#sec014">study</a> by Kiesha Prem, Alex Cook, and Mark Jit estimated contact matrices for 152 countries, including the United States, using contact surveys and demographic data. We can download their contact matrix for the United States, multiply it by 0.2 to account for the reduced social mixing due to social distancing, and include it as a new parameter, C, in our model. You can view the code for the creation of C and the rest of this analysis at <a href="https://github.com/yangjasp/distill_site">https://github.com/yangjasp/distill_site</a>.</p>
<p>For our system of ordinary differential equations we now have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dS_i}{dt} &amp;= -\beta S_i C (I_i/N) + \omega R_i - \nu_{1i}  -  \nu_{2i} \\
\frac{dV_{1i}}{dt} &amp;=  \nu_{1i} - (1-\varphi_1) \beta V_{1i} C (I_i/N)\\
\frac{dV_{2i}}{dt} &amp;=  \nu_{2i} - (1-\varphi_2) \beta V_{2i} C (I_i/N)\\
\frac{dI_i}{dt} &amp;= \beta S_i I_i - \gamma I_i + (1-\varphi_1)\beta V_{1i} C (I_i/N) + (1-\varphi_2)\beta V_{2i} C (I_i/N) \\
\frac{dR_i}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I_i(1-\mu_i) - \omega R_i\\
\frac{dD_i}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I_i(\mu_i)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this model assumes that the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2\)</span> are constant across all age classes, while the death rate, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span>, and the vaccination rates, <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{1i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{2i}\)</span>, vary across classes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="completing-the-final-model">Completing the Final Model</h2>
<p>Introducing a contact matrix allows our model to more accurately capture the rate of transmission across age classes, but it does not account for the fact that asymptomatic carriers are much more likely to come into contact with susceptible individuals than symptomatic ones. With this fact in mind, we introduce one more parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span>, to represent the fraction of asymptomatic infections per age class. This addition should be an important one, as it will help our model better capture the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773055">reported</a> role of young adults as viral spreaders. Similarly to the approach described in a 2012 <a href="http://www.sherrytowers.com/towers_feng_2012.pdf">paper</a> by Tower and Feng, we can now split our infected (I<sub>s</sub>) classes into symptomatic (I<sup>s</sup>) and asymptomatic (I<sup>a</sup>) class. We will also create a new contact matrix, C<sup>s</sup>, which for our purposes will be a our old contact matrix, now called C<sup>a</sup>, multiplied by some constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> &lt; 1 which represents the fraction of contacts that a symptomatic individual makes compared to an asymptomatic individual on average. This gives us a revised final system of ordinary differential equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dS_i}{dt} &amp;= -\beta S_i [C^{a} (I^{a}_i/N_i) + C^{s} (I^{s}_i/N_i)] + \omega R_i - \nu_{1i}  -  \nu_{2i} \\
\frac{dV_{1i}}{dt} &amp;=  \nu_{1i}  - \beta (1-\varphi_{1}) V_{1i} [C^{a} (I_i/N_i) + C^{s}(I^{s}_i/N_i)] \\
\frac{dV_{2i}}{dt} &amp;=  \nu_{2i}  - \beta (1-\varphi_{2}) V_{2i} [C^{a} (I_i/N_i) + C^{s}(I^{s}_i/N_i)]\\
\frac{dI^{a}_i}{dt} &amp;=
\alpha_i\Big[\beta S_i [C^{a} (I^{a}_i/N_i) + C^{s} (I^{s}_i/N_i)] + \\ &amp;\phantom{=}
\beta (1-\varphi_{1}) V_{1i} [C^{a} (I_i/N_i) + C^{s}(I^{s}_i/N_i)] +  \\ &amp;\phantom{=}  \beta (1-\varphi_{2}) V_{2i} [C^{a} (I_i/N_i) + C^{s}(I^{s}_i/N_i)]\Big] -
\gamma I^{a}_i \\
\frac{dI^{s}_i}{dt} &amp;= (1-\alpha_i)\Big[\beta S_i [C^{a} (I^{a}_i/N_i) + C^{s} (I^{s}_i/N_i)] + \\ &amp;\phantom{=}
\beta (1-\varphi_{1}) V_{1i} [C^{a} (I_i/N_i) + C^{s}(I^{s}_i/N_i)] +  \\ &amp;\phantom{=}  \beta (1-\varphi_{2}) V_{2i} [C^{a} (I_i/N_i) + C^{s}(I^{s}_i/N_i)]\Big] -
\gamma I^{s}_i \\
\frac{dR_i}{dt} &amp;= (1-\mu_i)(\gamma I^{a}_i + \gamma I^{s}_i) - \omega R_i\\
\frac{dD_i}{dt} &amp;= \mu_i(\gamma I^{a}_i + \gamma I^{s}_i)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(C^{s} = k C^{a}\)</span> in our case (it doesn’t have to in all cases, clearly, but we will use this for simplicity). This is our final model.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="running-the-model">Running the Model</h2>
<p>We can now use this model to answer our original question about the rollout of vaccines with different efficacies by adjusting the rates at which they are given in each age class, <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{1i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{2i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So how do we set <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{1i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{2i}\)</span>? According to a recent Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-29/u-s-vaccinations-at-200-000-a-day-run-far-short-of-warp-speed">article</a>, approximately 200,000 people per day are being vaccinated against COVID-19 on average. This number is pretty low, and some experts have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/covid-us-needs-to-vaccinate-3-million-people-per-day-to-hit-goal.html">said</a> that this number needs to be much larger if the U.S. wants to reach its goals in 2021. Let’s say that the average number of vaccinations per day increases to 1 million in the new year. Since we defined <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{1i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{2i}\)</span> as the number of susceptible patients vaccinated per day, we can set a limit on the total vaccinations per day, <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000 = \sum_{i=1}^{18} \nu_{1i}+\nu_{2i}\)</span>. Here, we assume that the limiting factor in doses per day is the administration of them, not the availability of the vaccines themselves. Right now, this appears to be a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html">more than reasonable</a> assumption.</p>
