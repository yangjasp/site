## About Me 
I am a second-year PHD student in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I graduated from Grinnell College with a major in biology and concentration in statistics before earning an MSc in statistics from the University of Essex. I am currently researching study designs for measurement error correction with the [Shaw Lab](https://shawstat.org/) at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. My graduate studies are supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

My primary research interests include statistical decision theory, causal inference, and survey sampling. I am particularly motivated by questions in health policy and health services research, where I hope to draw stronger connections between modern statistical methods and real-world decision-making. I am also drawn to broader questions about rationality and the philosophy of science. You can reach me on Twitter @jyang29 or via email at jbyang@uw.edu. Thanks for visiting!
